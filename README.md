# Code Club
We use this repository to pass code around during a [mob programming] exercise. Please join in, all experience levels are welcome. Here are some steps you can do ahead of time to make it easier to get started:

1. Register for a [GitHub account].
2. Create a [new issue] on this repository to let us know that you'd like to participate. We can add you to the repository so you'll be able to share your code with the rest of the mob.
3. Install [Python 3] and [Git].
4. Once we add you, try making a change to this README file by adding your name to an upcoming session.

Don't worry if you get stuck. Create an issue to ask for help, or ask for help during your first session.
